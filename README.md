# Checkers
This is a vanilla javascript checkers game.
It is made with no underlying data. It gets locations and types of pieces from the board.
It does not enforce any rules except for standard diagonal moves and jump chaining, since the only data being stored is the selected token to move. 
It can support a range of board sizes, prompted at the load of the page.
